# Each Project Structure

This project follows a common folder layout used across all repositories:

    src/
    include/
    tests/
    third_party/
    
Note that third_party is identical in every project! thats why i do not upload it to github
## Setup for each project

Create third_party directory on your computer by cloning GoogleTest 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git third_party/googletest
```
